## 📋 Next Steps (YOU NEED TO DO)

### Step 1: Watch Deployment (2 min)
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

You should see:
- ⏳ "Building..." → ✅ "Deployment Complete"

### Step 2: Create Postgres Database (5 min)

**IMPORTANT:** Without this, data won't persist!

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your BugDex project
3. Click **Storage** tab
4. Click **Create Database**
5. Choose **Postgres**
6. Name: `bugdex-db`
7. Click **Create**

✨ **Environment variables auto-configure!**

### Step 3: Initialize Database (1 min)

Once database is created, visit:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/init-db
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Database initialized successfully"
}
```

This creates the `users` and `uploads` tables.

### Step 4: Test Everything (10 min)

Follow the checklist in `docs/DEPLOY_TONIGHT.md`:

#### Test 1: Wallet Connection ✅
- [ ] Visit your live app
- [ ] Click "Connect Wallet"
- [ ] Sign in successfully

#### Test 2: Upload & Persistence ✅
- [ ] Click Camera icon
- [ ] Upload bug photo
- [ ] Wait for AI identification
- [ ] **REFRESH PAGE** → Bug should still be there!

#### Test 3: Profile Persistence ✅
- [ ] Go to Profile page
- [ ] Edit name/bio/avatar
- [ ] Click Save
- [ ] **REFRESH PAGE** → Changes should persist!

#### Test 4: Blockchain Submission ✅
- [ ] Go to Collection
- [ ] Click "Submit for Voting"
- [ ] Approve transaction
- [ ] Should appear on Voting page

### "Relation does not exist"
- **Cause:** Database tables not initialized
- **Fix:** Visit `/api/init-db` (Step 3 above)

### Data doesn't persist
