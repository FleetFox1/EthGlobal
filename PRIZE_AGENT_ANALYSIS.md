## 🏆 FINAL DECISION: OUR 3 PRIZE SUBMISSIONS

### 🥇 Prize #1: PayPal USD (PYUSD) — $10,000
**Alignment Score: 10/10** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Effort: MINIMAL** (Already built)  
**Expected Return: $4,500-$10,000**

**Why This Is #1:**
- ✅ **100% DONE** - BugTokenV2 already uses PYUSD for $1 unlock
- ✅ **PERFECT ALIGNMENT** - We literally built what the prize asks for
- ✅ **3 TRACKS AVAILABLE** - Can win Grand Prize ($4.5k) + Consumer ($3.5k) + Possibilities ($2k)
- ✅ **MINIMUM EFFORT** - Just record demo video (30 min work)
- ✅ **HIGHEST ROI** - Best return for time invested

**What We Submit:**
- Demo video showing PYUSD unlock → BUG claims → bug submission flow
- Emphasize: "PYUSD payments fund gas pool for free NFT minting"

## ❌ Prizes We're NOT Submitting For (But Can Still Use Tech)

### Can Use Tech But Not Submit:
- **Hardhat 3** - Use it for development, but don't submit as prize
  - We already use it, easy to upgrade
  - But $5k pool not worth a submission slot vs others
  
- **Lighthouse** - Use for storage, but don't submit as prize
  - Great tech (9/10 alignment), but only $1k pool
  - Not worth submission slot vs Blockscout ($10k)
  
- **Envio HyperIndex** - Use if time permits, but don't submit
  - Would be useful for leaderboard
  - But $5k pool + medium effort not optimal

### Skip Entirely:
- Hedera (wrong chain)
- Pyth (don't need oracles)
- ASI Alliance (AI agents not core)
- Lit Protocol (no DeFi automation)
- Arcology (no parallel execution)
- Yellow (state channels not relevant)
- EVVM (too experimental)
