## 🎯 Tomorrow's Plan: Testnet Deployment

**After your kitchen shift:**

### Step 1: Choose Network (5 minutes)
**Option A: Sepolia (Ethereum Testnet)**
- More established
- Better tooling
- ETHGlobal standard

**Option B: Polygon Amoy (Polygon Testnet)**
- Faster transactions
- Lower gas costs
- Also ETHGlobal compatible

### Step 2: Get Testnet Tokens (5 minutes)
- Visit faucet website
- Request free test ETH/MATIC
- Wait for tokens to arrive

### Step 3: Get RPC Provider (10 minutes)
- Sign up for Infura or Alchemy (free)
- Get API key
- Save RPC URL

### Step 4: Deploy Contracts (15 minutes)
```bash
cd apps/contracts
# Update hardhat.config.ts with network
# Add private key to .env
pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
# Get contract addresses
```

### Step 5: Update Frontend (5 minutes)
- Add contract addresses to `apps/web/.env.local`
- Test API routes with real contracts

### Step 6: Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)
- Connect GitHub repo
- Add environment variables
- Deploy!

**Total Time**: ~1 hour

## 📝 Tomorrow's Checklist

### Before You Start
- [ ] Have MetaMask installed (or we'll generate wallet)
- [ ] Ready to sign up for Infura/Alchemy (free account)
- [ ] 1 hour of focused time

### During Deployment
- [ ] Choose network (Sepolia or Polygon)
- [ ] Get testnet tokens from faucet
- [ ] Sign up for RPC provider
- [ ] Update `hardhat.config.ts` with network config
- [ ] Deploy contracts with `pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia`
- [ ] Save contract addresses from deployment output
- [ ] Update `apps/web/.env.local` with addresses
- [ ] Test API route locally: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/submissions`

### After Deployment

## 🎓 What You Learned Today

1. **Git Workflow**: Branch merging, conflict resolution, rebase
2. **TypeScript**: Type annotations, fixing compiler errors
3. **Hardhat**: Smart contract structure, ethers integration
4. **IPFS**: Decentralized storage with Lighthouse
5. **Full-Stack Architecture**: How contracts, APIs, and frontend connect

---

## 💡 Tips for Tomorrow

### Before Deployment
1. **Pull latest changes** from your partner:
   ```bash
   git pull origin integration/merge-frontend
   ```

2. **Test build** to ensure everything still works:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web && pnpm build
   ```

### During Deployment
1. **Save everything** - Contract addresses, transaction hashes
2. **Take screenshots** - Especially of deployment output
3. **Test incrementally** - Deploy one contract, test, then next
4. **Don't rush** - If something fails, we can troubleshoot

### Common Issues (and fixes)
- **"Insufficient funds"** → Need more testnet tokens from faucet
- **"Network error"** → Check RPC URL in hardhat.config.ts
- **"Nonce too high"** → Reset MetaMask account
- **"Gas estimation failed"** → Contract has a bug (unlikely, tests pass!)
