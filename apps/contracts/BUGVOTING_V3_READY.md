# BugVotingV3 - Strict Voting Rules 🔒

## 🆕 What Changed in V3

### Key Improvements:
1. **REQUIRES 3 day waiting period** - No early resolution
2. **REQUIRES minimum 5 "for" votes** - Quality control
3. **Vote count = popularity score** - Saved to NFT metadata
4. **Prevents abuse** - Low-quality submissions rejected
