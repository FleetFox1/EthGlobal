# 🔍 Why BugDex Uses Blockscout Custom Explorer

## The Problem We Solved

### Before Blockscout:
- ❌ Users sent to generic **Etherscan** with millions of unrelated transactions
- ❌ Broke user experience - left our app to see transaction details
- ❌ No branding - looked unprofessional
- ❌ Required API keys for programmatic access (rate limits!)
- ❌ Can't customize or add BugDex-specific features

### After Blockscout:
- ✅ **Custom branded explorer** matching BugDex UI
- ✅ **Focused on Sepolia** - only testnet transactions (easier to find yours)
- ✅ **Integrated seamlessly** - transaction popups link directly to our explorer
- ✅ **No API limits** - direct blockchain access
- ✅ **Professional presentation** for judges and users

## Real Use Cases in BugDex

### 1. Transaction Transparency 🔗

**Staking Flow:**
```
User stakes 10 BUG → Popup shows:
"✅ Stake successful!
10 BUG staked for 'Butterfly Photo'
View transaction: https://bugdex-explorer.cloud.blockscout.com/tx/0x..."
```

**User clicks link → sees:**
- Exact gas cost (helps them budget)
- Contract address (builds trust)
- Block confirmation (shows it's permanent)
- Event logs (BugStaked event visible)

### 2. Reward Distribution Verification 💰

**After Voting Ends:**
```
Admin distributes rewards → Users can verify:
- Who voted on their submission
- Exactly 5 BUG per upvote
- Total rewards calculated correctly
- No manipulation (on-chain proof)
```

### 3. NFT Minting Proof 🎨

**When User Mints NFT:**
```
Popup shows transaction link → Explorer shows:
- BugMinted event with tokenId
- Rarity tier (Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary)
- Vote count that determined rarity
- IPFS hash of the bug photo
```

### 4. Debugging & Support 🛠️

**When Users Report Issues:**
- "My stake didn't work!" → Check transaction on Blockscout
- "Did I get rewards?" → Search their address, see transfers
- "Where's my NFT?" → Check mint transaction for tokenId

## Technical Integration

### Transaction Popups

**File:** `apps/web/app/collection/page.tsx`

```typescript
// After staking transaction completes
const stakeReceipt = await stakeTx.wait();

// Import Blockscout utility
const { getTransactionUrl } = await import('@/lib/blockscout');

// Show popup with explorer link
alert(`🎉 Stake successful!
10 BUG staked for "${upload.title}"

View transaction:
${getTransactionUrl(stakeReceipt.hash)}`);
```

### URL Generation

**File:** `apps/web/lib/blockscout.tsx`

```typescript
// Reads custom URL from environment
export const BLOCKSCOUT_BASE_URL = 
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKSCOUT_URL || 
  'https://sepolia.etherscan.io'; // Fallback

// Generate transaction URL
export function getTransactionUrl(txHash: string): string {
  return `${BLOCKSCOUT_BASE_URL}/tx/${txHash}`;
}

// Generate address URL
export function getAddressUrl(address: string): string {
  return `${BLOCKSCOUT_BASE_URL}/address/${address}`;
}
```

### Environment Configuration

**Vercel Environment Variable:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOCKSCOUT_URL=https://bugdex-explorer.cloud.blockscout.com
```

**Why NEXT_PUBLIC_?**
- Makes URL available in browser (client-side)
- Users' browsers fetch directly from Blockscout
- No backend proxy needed = faster!
