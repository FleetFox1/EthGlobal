## 🔀 Conflicts Resolved

### README.md
**Conflict**: Both branches updated the README with different feature lists

**Resolution**:
- Combined frontend and backend features into separate sections
- Added all frontend pages to roadmap (marked complete ✅)
- Updated documentation links to include frontend docs
- Preserved backend API routes, smart contracts, and IPFS sections

**Result**: Comprehensive README showing full-stack application

## 🧪 Next Steps: Integration Testing

### 1. Test Frontend Pages
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm install  # Update dependencies
pnpm dev      # Start dev server
```

Visit these pages to test:
- http://localhost:3000 - Homepage with scan button
- http://localhost:3000/collection - Grid/list view
- http://localhost:3000/leaderboard - Rankings
- http://localhost:3000/profile - User profile
- http://localhost:3000/about - Project info

### 2. Test Camera Modal
- Click the large circular scan button
- Grant camera permissions
- Capture or upload an image
- Check console for submit handler (not connected yet)

### 3. Deploy Contracts
```bash
cd apps/contracts
pnpm install
pnpm run node       # Terminal 1
pnpm run deploy:local  # Terminal 2
```

Copy contract addresses to `apps/web/.env.local`

### 4. Connect Frontend to Backend
The CameraModal's submit handler needs to be connected to:
```typescript
// In CameraModal.tsx, replace the TODO with:
const response = await fetch('/api/submit-bug', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData,
});
```

### 5. Test End-to-End Flow
1. Scan bug with camera → calls `/api/submit-bug`
2. View active submissions → calls `/api/submissions`
3. Vote on submission → calls `/api/vote`
4. Check user collection → calls `/api/user/[address]`

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Minor
- [ ] Test suite has 1 failing test (multi-user voting edge case)
- [ ] Frontend uses mock data - needs wallet connection
- [ ] No wallet integration yet (MetaMask/WalletConnect)

### Priority Fixes Needed
1. **Connect CameraModal to API** - Update submit handler
2. **Add wallet connection** - For user addresses
3. **Replace mock data** - Use real contract data
4. **Add loading states** - For API calls

---

## 🎯 Current Todo List

- [x] Merge frontend and backend branches
- [ ] Test all frontend pages locally
- [ ] Deploy contracts to local Hardhat node
- [ ] Update .env.local with contract addresses
- [ ] Connect CameraModal to submit-bug API
- [ ] Add wallet connection (MetaMask)
- [ ] Replace mock data with contract queries
- [ ] Test complete flow: scan → vote → mint
- [ ] Merge integration branch to main

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

### Why This Merge Was Needed
Your partner branched from `main` **before** you pushed the backend work. Their `frontend` branch didn't have:
- Smart contracts
- API routes  
- IPFS integration
- Backend utilities

If we had merged `frontend` → `backend/contracts`, it would have **deleted** 8,302 lines of backend code!

### The Correct Approach
✅ We merged `frontend` → `integration/merge-frontend` (based on `backend/contracts`)

This preserved all backend work while adding frontend pages.

### Going Forward
1. Both of you should work from `integration/merge-frontend` now
2. Once tested, merge to `main`
3. Delete old `frontend` and `backend/contracts` branches
4. Create feature branches from `main` going forward
