# 🎨 NFT Minting Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What's Working Now

Users can now mint NFTs for their approved bug submissions!

### User Flow:
1. ✅ Upload bug photo (free)
2. ✅ Stake 10 BUG to submit for voting
3. ✅ Community votes (free voting)
4. ✅ Get stake back + 5 BUG per upvote
5. ✅ **Mint NFT button appears** (if approved)
6. ✅ Click "Mint NFT" → MetaMask popup
7. ✅ NFT minted with rarity based on votes!

## 🎯 NFT Rarity System

Rarity is automatically calculated based on upvotes:

| Votes | Rarity | Emoji | Color |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 0-1 | Common | ⚪ | Gray |
| 2-4 | Uncommon | 🟢 | Green |
| 5-9 | Rare | 🔵 | Blue |
| 10-19 | Epic | 🟣 | Purple |
| 20+ | Legendary | 🟠 | Orange |

**More upvotes = Rarer NFT!** This incentivizes quality bug photos. 📸

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Authorize Minting

The BugNFT contract requires authorization before users can mint. 

### Option A: Authorize Your Deployer Wallet (Recommended for Testing)

Run this script to allow yourself to mint:

```powershell
cd apps/contracts
pnpm hardhat run scripts/authorize-minter.ts --network sepolia
```

This authorizes the deployer wallet (you) to mint NFTs.

### Option B: Make Minting Public (For Production)

If you want ANY user to be able to mint their approved bugs:

1. Edit `apps/contracts/scripts/authorize-minter.ts`
2. Uncomment the "Option 2" section:
```typescript
console.log("\n2️⃣ Making minting public...");
// Allow anyone to mint (special address: ZeroAddress)
const publicMintTx = await BugNFT.authorizeMinter(ethers.ZeroAddress);
await publicMintTx.wait();
console.log("✅ Public minting enabled!");
```
3. Run the script
4. Now ALL users can mint their approved bugs!

## 🧪 Testing Minting

### Test with Your Approved Submission:

Your buddy's submission was approved and has rewards. Perfect for testing!

1. Go to https://bugdex.life/collection (as the submitter)
2. Find the approved submission
3. Should see green "✅ APPROVED" badge
4. Should see "Mint NFT" button with rarity
5. Click "Mint [Rarity] NFT"
6. MetaMask popup → Confirm transaction
7. Wait ~15 seconds
8. Success! NFT minted 🎉

### What Gets Minted:

```json
{
  "tokenId": "Auto-incremented (1, 2, 3...)",
  "owner": "Your wallet address",
  "ipfsHash": "Metadata CID from Lighthouse",
  "rarity": "Calculated from votes (0-4)",
  "discoverer": "Your address",
  "discoveryTime": "Block timestamp",
  "voteCount": "Number of upvotes",
  "verified": true
}
```

### Token URI:
```
ipfs://[your-metadata-cid]
```

This points to the JSON metadata on IPFS with:
- Image URL
- Bug name
- Scientific name
- Location
- Attributes (rarity, votes, etc.)

## 🔗 Blockscout Integration

Once you set up Blockscout (see `BLOCKSCOUT_QUICK_SETUP.md`), NFT mint transactions will show on your custom explorer:

**Example:**
```
https://bugdex-sepolia.blockscout.com/tx/0x123abc...
```

Shows:
- ✅ Transaction details
- ✅ BugMinted event
- ✅ Token ID minted
- ✅ Gas used
- ✅ From/To addresses

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Not authorized to mint"**
- Run `authorize-minter.ts` script
- Or uncomment Option B for public minting

**"Contract address not configured"**
- Check `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUG_NFT_ADDRESS`
- Check Vercel env vars match

**"Network mismatch"**
- Code auto-switches to Sepolia
- User just needs to approve switch

**"Transaction failed"**
- Check gas (need ~0.001 ETH)
- Check authorization
- Check IPFS metadata CID is valid

**Gas Too High?**
- Sepolia gas is FREE (test ETH)
- But transaction size matters
- Metadata on IPFS keeps it cheap
