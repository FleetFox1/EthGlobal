# Off-Chain Voting System - Test Guide

## Testing the New FREE Voting Flow

This guide walks through testing the complete off-chain voting system to ensure:
1. ‚úÖ Submissions go to DATABASE (not blockchain)
2. ‚úÖ Voting page loads from DATABASE (not blockchain)
3. ‚úÖ Votes are FREE (no gas, no wallet popup)
4. ‚úÖ Only approved bugs mint to blockchain

---

## Test Flow

### 1. Upload a Bug Photo
**Location:** Home page (Camera modal)

1. Click "Capture Bug" button
2. Take a photo or upload an image
3. Wait for AI identification
4. Click "Save to Collection"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ Photo uploaded to Pinata IPFS
- ‚úÖ Saved to database with `voting_status = 'not_submitted'`
- ‚úÖ NO blockchain transaction
- ‚úÖ Appears in Collection page

---

### 2. View in Collection Page
**Location:** `/collection`

**Expected Display:**
```
üíæ Saved Off-Chain
Submit for FREE community voting! If approved, you can mint an NFT.

[Submit for Community Voting (FREE)] button
```

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Says "FREE" (not "Requires 10 BUG")
- ‚úÖ No mention of gas costs
- ‚úÖ Button is NOT grayed out

---

### 3. Submit for Voting (FREE!)
**Action:** Click "Submit for Community Voting (FREE)"

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ NO MetaMask/wallet popup
- ‚úÖ Instant success message
- ‚úÖ Alert shows:
  ```
  Bug submitted for community voting! üéâ
  
  ‚úÖ Submission is FREE (no gas cost)
  üó≥Ô∏è Voting period: 3 days
  ‚è∞ Ends: [date]
  
  Community members can now vote on your discovery!
  ```
- ‚úÖ Database updated: `voting_status = 'pending_voting'`
- ‚úÖ `voting_deadline` set to +3 days
- ‚úÖ `votes_for = 0, votes_against = 0`

**Verify in Collection:**
Bug card now shows:
```
üó≥Ô∏è In Community Voting
Votes For: 0
Votes Against: 0
Ends: [date]
```

---

### 4. View on Voting Page (DATABASE, NOT BLOCKCHAIN!)
**Location:** `/voting`

**Critical Test:**
1. Go to Voting page
2. Should say: "Loading submissions from database..." (NOT "Loading from blockchain...")
3. Your submission should appear IMMEDIATELY
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check blockchain explorer - there should be NO transaction yet!

**Expected Display:**
- Header: "Community Voting (FREE)"
- Subtitle: "Vote on bug submissions ‚Ä¢ No gas fees ‚Ä¢ Help the community"
- Info banner: "Voting is 100% FREE (no gas, no tokens!)"
- Your bug appears in "All" tab with vote buttons

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Submission appears on voting page
- ‚úÖ NO blockchain transaction exists
- ‚úÖ Says "FREE" everywhere
- ‚úÖ Shows vote counts (should be 0/0)

---

### 5. Vote on Submission (FREE!)
**Action:** From another wallet/account, click "üëç Yes" or "üëé No" button

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ NO MetaMask/wallet popup
- ‚úÖ Instant vote recording
- ‚úÖ Alert shows:
  ```
  Vote recorded! üéâ
  
  Your vote: üëç FOR (or üëé AGAINST)
  
  Votes are FREE and stored in the database!
  ```
- ‚úÖ Vote counts update immediately
- ‚úÖ Database `votes` table has new row
- ‚úÖ `uploads.votes_for` or `uploads.votes_against` incremented

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Vote count updates without page refresh
- ‚úÖ NO gas fee charged
- ‚úÖ Can see "‚úì You voted" on the card after voting
- ‚úÖ Check database: `votes` table has entry with your address

---

### 6. Check Blockchain Status
**Critical Verification:**

Go to blockchain explorer (Sepolia Etherscan):
- Search for BugVotingV3 contract address
- Check recent transactions
- **EXPECTED:** NO new transactions! Submission and voting are 100% off-chain

**If you see blockchain transactions during voting, the system is BROKEN!**

---

### 7. Vote Approval Simulation
**After voting period or enough votes:**

**If approved (votes_for > votes_against):**

Collection page should show:
```
‚úÖ Approved by Community!
Your bug passed voting! Click below to mint your NFT on the blockchain.

[Mint NFT (Costs Gas)] button (GREEN)
```

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ `voting_status = 'approved'`
- ‚úÖ `voting_approved = true`
- ‚úÖ Button says "Costs Gas" (honest!)
- ‚úÖ Still NO blockchain transaction until you click "Mint NFT"

---

### 8. Mint NFT (ONLY blockchain transaction)
**Action:** Click "Mint NFT (Costs Gas)" button

**Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ NOW MetaMask pops up (first time asking for wallet!)
- ‚úÖ Transaction requires gas
- ‚úÖ NFT minted on blockchain
- ‚úÖ Database updated: `voting_status = 'submitted_to_blockchain'`
- ‚úÖ `transaction_hash` recorded

**Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Blockchain transaction exists (check Etherscan)
- ‚úÖ NFT appears in wallet
- ‚úÖ Only ONE blockchain transaction (not 10+ like old system)

---

## What Changed from Old System?

### OLD System (Expensive, Wasteful):
```
Upload ‚Üí Submit to Blockchain ($$$) ‚Üí Vote on Blockchain ($$$) ‚Üí Mint NFT ($$$)
Total: 10+ blockchain transactions
Cost: $3-5+ in gas fees
Problem: Rejected bugs still cost money!
```

### NEW System (FREE until approved):
```
Upload ‚Üí Submit for Voting (FREE) ‚Üí Vote in Database (FREE) ‚Üí If Approved: Mint NFT ($)
Total: 1 blockchain transaction (only if approved)
Cost: $0 for voting, ~$0.50 for minting (if approved)
Benefit: Rejected bugs cost NOTHING!
```

---

## API Endpoints Used

### Database Endpoints (FREE):
- `POST /api/submit-for-voting` - Submit bug for voting
- `POST /api/vote-offchain` - Cast vote
- `GET /api/vote-offchain?uploadId=X&voterAddress=0x...` - Check vote status
- `GET /api/voting-submissions?status=pending_voting` - Get voting submissions

### Blockchain Endpoints (Only for approved bugs):
- Contract: `bugVoting.submitBug()` - Mint approved bug as NFT
- Gas required: Yes (only for minting)

---

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Submission appears on blockchain immediately
**Problem:** Old `submitToBlockchain` function still being called
**Fix:** Ensure collection page uses `submitForVoting()` not `submitToBlockchain()`

### Issue: Voting requires gas
**Problem:** Voting page calling blockchain contract
**Fix:** Ensure voting page uses `/api/vote-offchain` not `writeContract()`

### Issue: Submission doesn't appear on voting page
**Problem:** Voting page loading from blockchain
**Fix:** Ensure voting page calls `/api/voting-submissions` not contract-read

### Issue: "Loading from blockchain..." message
**Problem:** Old loading message
**Fix:** Update to "Loading submissions from database..."

---

## Database Verification

### Check Database Directly:

```sql
-- Check submission status
SELECT id, voting_status, votes_for, votes_against, voting_deadline, voting_approved 
FROM uploads 
WHERE wallet_address = '0xYourAddress'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Check votes
SELECT * FROM votes 
WHERE upload_id = 'your-upload-id';
```

**Expected values after submission:**
- `voting_status`: 'pending_voting'
- `voting_deadline`: 3 days from now
- `votes_for`: 0 initially, increases with votes
- `votes_against`: 0 initially, increases with votes

**Expected after voting:**
- `votes` table has row for each vote
- UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicate votes
- Vote counts match votes table

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Test PASSES if:**
1. Submission to voting is instant (no wallet popup)
2. NO blockchain transactions during submission/voting
3. Voting page loads from database (not blockchain)
4. Votes are FREE (no gas fees)
5. Approved bugs show "Mint NFT" button
6. Minting NFT is the ONLY blockchain transaction
7. Rejected bugs cost $0 (no wasted gas)

‚ùå **Test FAILS if:**
1. Wallet popup appears during submission
2. Blockchain transactions happen before approval
3. Gas fees required for voting
4. Voting page shows "Loading from blockchain..."
5. Submission doesn't appear on voting page
6. Database not updated with vote counts

---

## Next Steps After Testing

If tests pass:
1. ‚úÖ Off-chain voting system working!
2. Test with multiple users voting
3. Test voting deadline expiration
4. Implement auto-resolution (close voting after 3 days)
5. Add admin panel to approve/reject bugs manually

If tests fail:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check API endpoint responses
3. Verify database schema (voting columns exist)
4. Ensure migration ran successfully
5. Review OFFCHAIN_VOTING_SYSTEM.md documentation

## Cost Comparison

### Per Bug Submission:

**Old System:**
- Submit to blockchain: $0.50
- 5 votes at $0.50 each: $2.50
- Mint NFT: $0.50
- **Total if rejected: $3.50 WASTED** üí∏

**New System:**
- Submit for voting: $0 (FREE)
- 5 votes: $0 (FREE)
- Mint NFT (if approved): $0.50
- **Total if rejected: $0 WASTED** üéâ

**Savings: $3.50 per rejected bug!**

If 100 bugs submitted and 50% rejected:
- Old system waste: $175
- New system waste: $0
- **Total savings: $175** üöÄ
