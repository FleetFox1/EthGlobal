## ‚ùå Prizes We're NOT Submitting For (But Can Still Use Tech)

### Can Use Tech But Not Submit:
- **Hardhat 3** - Use it for development, but don't submit as prize

- **Lighthouse** - Use for storage, but don't submit as prize
  - Great tech (9/10 alignment), but only $1k pool
  - Not worth submission slot vs Blockscout ($10k)
  
- **Envio HyperIndex** - Use if time permits, but don't submit
  - Would be useful for leaderboard
  - But $5k pool + medium effort not optimal

### Skip Entirely:
- Hedera (wrong chain)
- Pyth (don't need oracles)
- ASI Alliance (AI agents not core)
- Lit Protocol (no DeFi automation)
- Arcology (no parallel execution)
- Yellow (state channels not relevant)
- EVVM (too experimental)
